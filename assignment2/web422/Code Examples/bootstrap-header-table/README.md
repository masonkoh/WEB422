## Bootstrap-Header-Table

This is an example of creating a scrollable fixed-header table using the Bootstrap 3.3.7 responsive grid classes.

The SCSS file has two variables: 

* **$bootstrap-header-table-height** This is used to show the max height of the scrollable table - defaulted to 300px;
* **$bootstrap-header-table-color** This is used as a base colour for the table - defaulted to #F5F5F5;

Please see the "bootstrap-header-table.html" file for examples on how to format your HTML to use the table
